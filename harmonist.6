.Sh DESCRIPTION
Harmonist is a stealth coffee-break roguelike game.
The game has a heavy focus on tactical positioning, light and noise mechanisms,
making use of various terrain types and cones of view for monsters.
Aiming for a replayable streamlined experience, the game avoids complex
inventory management and character building, relying on items and player
adaptability for character progression.
.Pp
“Your friend Shaedra got captured by nasty people from the Dayoriah Clan while
she was trying to retrieve a powerful magara artifact that was stolen from the
great magara-specialist Marevor Helith.
.Pp
As a gawalt monkey, you don't understand much why people complicate so much
their lives caring about artifacts and the like, but one thing is clear: you
have to rescue your friend, somewhere to be found in this Underground area
controlled by the Dayoriah Clan.
If what you heard the guards say is true, Shaedra's imprisoned on the eighth
floor.
.Pp
You are small and have good night vision, so you hope the infiltration
will go smoothly...”
