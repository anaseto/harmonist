v0.4.1 2021-03-?

This is a bugfix release mainly based on helpful feedback by players.

+ Fixed the tiles SDL version on windows.
+ Improvements in the SDL version: window title and icon.
+ Remove an unfriendly error message when save is from a previous version and
  thus cannot be loaded.
+ Mention zoom functionality for SDL version in key bindings help.
+ Fix a bug in pathfinding on map's left and right edges.

v0.4 2021-02-22

Highligths:

+ A new field of view algorithm (symmetric shadow casting combined with the
  previous custom one) that should offer a better stealthy experience thanks to
  expanding shadows and less permissive vision in general.
+ Overhaul of the user interface and a lot of polishing. Among most noticeable
  changes for players, description for items and places is now displayed just
  by examining them, without requiring an additional keypress, and using the
  mouse does not force examination mode for keyboard anymore.
+ Improved Replay (arrow up and down moves 1 minute forward/backward).
+ New SDL driver that replaces the Tk one as graphical native driver.
+ Many minor bug fixes (including some minor gameplay tweaks).

Packaging notes: the game now uses the gruid library. This means that for the
terminal version it will use the tcell go library, and for graphical
applications the SDL library.

v0.3 2019-12-10

Highligths:

+ Improved monster AI: now they remember you!
+ Limited number of charges for magaras: you'll have to adapt your playstyle.
+ New core mechanic: jump by propulsing against walls!
+ Improved map generation and special events (mist and earthquake)
+ 2 new terrain features: fake stairs and queen rock that amplifies sound.
+ 4 new monsters, a new cloak, 6 new magaras and 2 old ones reworked, and
  potions.

More detailed list:

+ Improve monster AI: now they behave differently after they have spotted you
  at least once. Exact behavior depends on the type of monster, but they all
  have a chance of exploring around the last place they saw you at, in addition
  to their normal duties.
+ Magaras now have a maximum number of charges, to avoid spamming of a single
  magara.
+ You can now jump 2 or 3 tiles away by propulsing yourself against walls,
  which leaves you exhausted for a few turns, as the usual over monster jumps.
  A significant buff for acrobatics cloak!
+ Greatly improve and diversify map generation, in particular the tunnel
  generation algorithm used for all kind of maps.
+ New special events: mist level and earthquake.
+ New special map layouts more or less urbanised than the common ones.
+ Many new special rooms.
+ New terrain feature: fake stairs (harmonic illusions).
+ New terrain feature: queen rock, special terrain that amplifies sound, so
  that even so you're usually very silent, your footsteps on such rocks will be
  heard. One more use for levitation magara!
+ New unique monster: Crazy Imp that sings and plays guitar, attracting
  unwanted attention.
+ New monster: haze cat, with very good night vision.
+ New monster: spiders, with panoramic vision and confusing bite.
+ New monster: acid mounds, whose bite corrodes magara charges.
+ Satowalga plants acidic projectiles may now corrode your magara charges,
  instead of slowing you.
+ New cloak of conversion, that generates MP from lost HP.
+ New magara of energy that replenishes HP and MP, but only has one charge.
+ New magara of transparency that makes you transparent (visible only to
  adjacent monsters) when standing of a lighted cell.
+ New magara of delayed noise: it will produce harmonic noise in your current
  position after a certain number of turns.
+ New magara of disguise: it will disguise you with illusions into a guard, so
  that most monsters that are not already chasing you will be friendly (except
  some monsters with good flair).
+ New special magara of dispersal that makes monster hitting you blink away.
+ New special magara of delayed oric explosion that generates a big oric
  explosion that destroys walls in a wide area.
+ Remove player and monster speed: a turn is now always 1, no half turns.
+ Replace magara of slowing with magara of paralysis, a stronger but shorter
  variation on lignification (may change in the future).
+ Rework magara of swiftness to give several “free” moves, which is more
  intuitive than previous behavior.
+ New potion items: they have an on-drink effect when you move onto them. You
  cannot carry them.
+ Some monsters now have resistances/counter against some effects: satowalga
  plants and tree mushrooms cannot be lignified, blinking frogs partially
  reflect teleportation effects (they teleport but you too), haze cats have
  shallow sleep (they wake up very fast after falling asleep).
+ Improved magical stone placement, and chances of getting a particular kind of
  stone may depend on whether it's inside or outside a building.
+ Display number of remaining turns for monsters statuses too.
+ Various balance adjustments, like 1 more HP and MP, but less bananas,
  encouraging better strategic play.
+ Fix/improve many animations.
+ Fix bug which could lead to negative number of bananas when jumping into
  chasm.
+ Fix rare bug when blinking to the same place.
+ Make “x” key work in key settings menu too.
+ Minor UI/messages/stats improvements and other miscellaneous bug fixes.
