v0.3-dev

+ Improve monster AI: now they behave differently after they have spotted you
  at least once. Exact behavior depends on the type of monster, but they all
  have a chance of exploring around the last place they saw you at, in addition
  to their normal duties.
+ Greatly improve tunnel generation used for all map generation algorithms,
  resulting in more varied and interesting maps.
+ Magaras now have a maximum number of charges, to avoid spamming of a single
  magara.
+ New special map layouts more or less urbanised than the common ones.
+ New cloak of conversion, that generates MP from lost HP.
+ New terrain feature: fake stairs (harmonic illusions).
+ New unique monster: Crazy Imp that sings and plays guitar.
+ New monster: haze cat, with very good night vision.
+ New monster: spiders, with panoramic vision and confusing bite.
+ New monster: acid mounds, with magara charge corroding byte.
+ Satowalga plants now may corrode your magara charges, instead of slowing you.
+ New magara of energy that replenishes HP and MP, but only has one charge.
+ New magara of transparency that makes you transparent (visible only to
  adjacent monsters) when standing of a lighted cell.
+ Remove player and monster speed: a turn is now always 1, no half turns.
+ Replace magara of slowing with magara of paralysis, a stronger but shorter
  variation on lignification (may change in the future).
+ Rework magara of swiftness to give several “free” moves, which is more
  intuitive than previous behavior.
+ Many new special rooms.
+ New potion items: they have an on-drink effect when you move onto them. You
  cannot carry them.
+ Various balance adjustments.
+ Display number of remaining turns for monsters statuses too.
+ Fix rare bug when blinking to the same place.
+ Make “x” key work in key settings menu.

  chasm.
