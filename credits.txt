Boohu has been a source of inspiration for quite a few things in Harmonist,
which should come as no surprise given that Harmonist is originally derived
from the same code: LOS functionality is similar (for example for dense
foliage, doors, ...)., many monsters/tiles/items are similar, length of the
game is similar too, and both games take place in the same world. The core
mechanics are very different, though, and lore is much more developed in
Harmonist.

Boohu.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Harmonist takes some inspiration from various non-roguelike stealth-games,
though mainly for some simple mechanics (like cone of view for monsters from
Commandos/Shadow Tactics-like games, or hiding in items like in Ghost of a
Tale).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The world and narrative are inspired by the fantasy Saga “El Ciclo de Shaedra”.

Also, reading stuff about roguelikes here and there, in particular in the
/r/roguelikedev subreddit where I've been sharing updates on the game, has
without a doubt greatly influenced Harmonist in many ways, from UI ideas to
gameplay ones.
